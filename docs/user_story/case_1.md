## User Story 1: Making an Account and Logging in

The user will first be prompted to log in with Google or Facebook. This will then create a pop-up window where the user can select the account and give the necessary consent to have their account accessed. If the user needs to create an account, they will be prompted to do so. Once the user has entered their login information, the page will reload and display user information.
