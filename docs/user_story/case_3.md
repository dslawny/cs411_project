## User Story 3: Generating and Saving a Playlist
Actor: Web Application User

Description: This scenario describes where a user requests an Uber/Lyft ride and subsequently will be able to generate a playlist to be accessed for uniquely for the ride

After An actor has requested an Uber/Lyft ride, our web application will use past listening behavior and the actor's destination to generate a playlist. A prompt will appear suggesting a curated playlist for the specific destination based on previous music listening history. At this point in the process it is already assumed the user has both an Uber/Lyft and Spotify account. If the actor agrees to save the playlist, it will be loaded into Spotify and and saved for later use if so desired by the actor. If the actor refuses to save the playlist, it will be deleted and no longer prompt the user.
