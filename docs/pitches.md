## Idea 1: Spotify playlist recommendation based on Uber/Lyft rides

### Description: 
Our web application will generate and recommend playlists bases on a user's uber/lyft destination and duration of their trip. By using Uber/Lyft's API to calculate the duration of the trip, and spotify's API to determine the listening habits of the user, our appliacation will generate playlists that are timed perfectly with the ride.

Uber/Lyft API - Manage duration of rides and destinations.
Spotify API - Manage listening habits of the user and generation of playlists
## Idea 2: Movie/Show recommendation

### Description:
My friends and I always have problems deciding what to watch and spend a long time deciding. We could use IMDb's API to recommend shows/movies based on past favorites/genres. We could also use IBM Watson's API to determine from the user's mood from their Twitter feed so that they can search for movies to match their current mood. Maybe we could integrate Utelly's API to find/filter through what platform the show is available on.

This is just a test to see how branches work.
