## Idea 1: Discounted Leftover Meals and Ingredients

### Description: 
Each year, 40% of all edible food in the US is thrown away. We want to create an app that would sell or distribute leftover ingredients and foods at a discounted price. 

Google Places API

## Idea 2: Movie/Show recommendation

### Description:
My friends and I always have problems deciding what to watch and spend a long time deciding. We could use IMDb's API to recommend shows/movies based on past favorites/genres. We could also use a mood selection so that the user can search for movies to match their current mood. Maybe we could integrate Utelly's API to find/filter through what platform the show is available on.

This is just a test to see how branches work.
